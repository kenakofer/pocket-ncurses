				<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>Traditional book reviews tend to focus on a single book, such as <i><A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/Just-Giving-Philanthropy-Failing-Democracy/dp/069118349X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=just+giving&#038;qid=1569862867&#038;s=gateway&#038;sr=8-1&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=slatestarcode-20&#038;linkId=dddf7a975ad34f028bc219522b5afcc9&#038;language=en_US">Just Giving</A></i> by Rob Reich. We ought, however, to be reviewing a broader question: what is the role of books in a liberal democratic society? And what role <i>should</i> they play?</p>
<p>Books were first invented during the early Bronze Age. Plato states people fiercely opposed the first books; in his dialogue <A HREF="http://apt46.net/2011/05/18/socrates-was-against-writing/"><i>Phaedrus</i></A>, he recalls the Egyptian priests&#8217; objection to early writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Writing] will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrast the Egyptian scribes&#8217; reception with the ceaseless praise given to the authors of our age. Rather than asking about the purposes of writing and the power of authors, we tend instead to celebrate writers, large and small, for their brilliance. But in our age, these are questions we should pose with greater urgency. Scholarly literature like <i>Just Giving</i> is an unaccountable, nontransparent, and perpetual exercise of power. It deserves more criticism than it has received.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a conventional story to tell about book-writing and its relation to liberty. The story is this. Book-writing is thought to be tightly connected to liberty. This is so for two reasons. First, writing or reading a book is voluntary. Second, the exercise of liberty involves freedom of speech. This story is an attractive one, and it contains some truth. But it ignores that book-writing is inherently embedded in state institutions, like intellectual property laws. It should not be understood in the simplistic manner of an activity that takes place within a framework of nonintervention by the state, or as nothing more than private individual decisions to express thoughts. Instead, it must be understood as embedded in political institutions, laws, and public policy. Books may not be an invention of the state, but they are an artifact of it. </p>
<p>Most importantly, book-writing is heavily subsidized by the government. <A HREF="https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/authors-take-advantage-of-the-new-tax-deduction/">Authors receive a &#8220;pass-through&#8221; tax deduction</A> of up to 20%. In addition, <A HREF="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/tax-deduction-tips-for-authors-2799906">they can deduct</A> most of the expenses they incur in writing a book, from freelance editing to literary agents to promotional events. In extending these tax incentives, federal and state treasuries forego tax revenue. Or to put it differently, tax incentives for writing books constitute a a kind of spending program. In fact, the fiscal effects of a direct spending program and a tax expenditure are exactly the same. In Suzanne Mettler&#8217;s apt phrase, federal policy driven by tax expenditures rather than direct spending constitutes the &#8220;submerged state&#8221;, obscured from public view and accountability, but with powerful distributional consequences. These tax breaks amount to massive federal and state subsidies for the creation and dissemination of written texts. They are supplemented by millions spent on libraries, literacy programs, and in some cases <A HREF="https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2015/11/stop-the-presses-or-at-least-stop-their-subsidies/">direct subsidies to book publishers</A>. </p>
<p>A respect for the liberty of individuals to promote their views is one thing; subsidizing its exercise is another. The state does not merely permit and set guidelines within which writing takes place &#8211; offering the state&#8217;s imprimatur to every book and pamphlet and magazine and journal article &#8211; but is in a fiscally meaningful way actively participating in what authors do. If the state is actively funding, through a tax expenditure, some bad book, it makes the state partially complicit in the harm that the book causes. It is no exaggeration to say that as book-writing is currently structured, when authors do harm, so does the state. It is incorrect to say that mediocre books merely waste the time of the author and reader. Rather, writing a mediocre book squanders assets that are partially the public&#8217;s.</p>
<p>With this description of the relationship between book-writing and liberty in place, let us now consider whether the ideal of equality is playing any role in the institutional design of the policies. The median annual wage of authors <A HREF="https://collegegrad.com/careers/writers-and-authors">is $62,000</A>, twice the average US income <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States">of $31,000</A>. Authors are most likely to be college-educated, upper class, and be the sorts of people who can take months off of their jobs to write a book. Scholarly books are often written by professors, a member of a tiny and unelected intellectual elite. This makes their immense ability to exercise power by writing a book and getting it published deeply troubling. Or consider a famous author like Jeffrey Sachs, whose successful books permit him to stride upon the world stage as if he were a head of state. </p>
<p>Perhaps books could play important roles in democratic societies, despite being an exercise of power and expression of plutocratic voice, if they were subject to different legal arrangements. But it is no coincidence that the wealthy dominate book-writing. The tax code is set up to unfairly privilege books by the well-off over the poor in two ways. First, the pass-through deduction and freelance editor deduction are available only to those individuals who itemize their deductions &#8211; people who opt not to take the so-called standard deduction on their income tax. This effectively penalizes, or fails to reward and provide an incentive for, all people who do not itemize their deductions, a group that constitutes roughly 70% of taxpayers. Thus the low-income renter who does not itemize her deductions but pays $500 to get their book edited receives no tax concession, while the high-income house owner who pays the same $500 fee can claim a deduction. Second, the tax subsidy given to those who do receive the deduction possesses what is known as an &#8220;upside-down effect&#8221;. The deduction functions as an increasingly greater subsidy with every higher step in the income tax bracket. Both of these features of the tax code are arbitrary and unfairly benefit the well-off. The choice of the the pass-through and business expenses tax deductions as the preferred tax policy for book-writing introduces a potent plutocratic bias.</p>
<p>Proponents of books might suggest that they nevertheless serve a compelling public interest in the form of spreading knowledge. But when we move away from individual works and consider the total distribution of literature, we find a pattern of writing that is hard to reconcile with expectations of educational outcomes. For anyone who believes that books imply something about knowledge or truth or education, the sunny picture of American book publishing here becomes decidedly cloudy.</p>
<p><A HREF="https://www.statista.com/statistics/201404/types-of-books-that-american-adults-read/">Figure 1</A> demonstrates that the most popular type of book in the US is &#8220;mystery, thriller, or true crime&#8221;. Second and third place are held by history and biographies, which may perhaps be edifying to some people. But after that we get romance, cookbooks, science fiction, and fantasy. Literary classics and books on important current affairs are far down the list, only a fraction of total books read. What can we conclude from these data? The lesson is obvious: if we believe the purpose of reading and writing to be predominantly educational, an important mechanism to provide for our enlightenment and edification, the actually existing distribution of reading in the United States does not meet the test. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Finally, we must address the question of intergenerational justice. Books are designed to enshrine author intent and express their opinions in perpetuity. Thus does the dead hand of the author potentially extend from beyond the grave to strangle future generations. John Stuart Mill famously wrote that &#8220;There is no fact in history which posterity will find it more difficult to understand, than the idea of perpetuity, and that any of the contrivances of man, should have been coupled together in any sane mind.&#8221; Yet authors deliberately &#8220;write for the ages&#8221;, producing works that can be studied for hundreds or even thousands of years. </p>
<p>We might ask whether books would be a welcome institutional arrangement if we were designing a democratic society from scratch. The catalogue of the oddities of the book suggests a strong case against. Books appear at odds with democracy, for they represent, by definition and by law, the expression of plutocratic voices directed to public education. But why, in a democracy, should the size of one&#8217;s wallet give one a greater say in public policy? Why should this plutocratic voice be subsidized by the public? And why should democracy allow this voice to extend across generations in the form of intellectual property laws? It would seem that books are a misplaced plutocratic and powerful element in a democratic society. And we can trace, in the evolution of books, the emergence of a particular kind of high-profile author such as Dan Brown, Stephen King, and J.K. Rowling, whose activity supplants the state, subverts public education processes, and in so doing diminishes democracy.</p>
<p>I find many points of agreement, especially when considering the actual content of books today. Yet despite all this, I think a role for books can be defended. First, books can help overcome problems in the marketplace of ideas by diminishing government orthodoxy and decentralizing the production of knowledge. Second, because of their size and longevity, books can operate on a different and longer timeline than government propaganda broadcasts, taking risks in the expression of ideas we should not routinely expect to see in press releases by government agencies. </p>
<p>This argument is not intended to justify the full range of legal permissions currently afforded to books, but it provides hints as to what a just literary world might look like. I worry, for instance, about the massive boom in short books. Books with fewer than 150 pages primarily serve the author&#8217;s vanity. What loss to public benefit would there be with a minimum page length to publish a book, say 250 or 300 pages? I think very little, and quite possibly there would be some gain, for people with less exciting ideas who could not reach the page threshold might be convinced to help other people with their books rather than writing their own. But even if books of all lengths do partly decentralize the definition and provision of knowledge, the resulting pluralism of literary voices will have a plutocratic, not fully democratic, cast. The experimental or heterodox opinions in books will represent the preferences of the wealthy, not of the wider citizenry. Indeed, there is empirical evidence to suggest that at least in the United States, the very wealthy have significantly more politically conservative preferences than average citizens. Thus, the activity of books, even when it decentralizes the production of knowledge, retains a plutocratic character. Does this mean that we should eliminate books? I do not think so. Perhaps a plutocratic tempering of government orthodoxy is better than no tempering at all. I conclude that the decentralization argument provides a plausibly but not definitive case for books as a democracy-supporting institutional design in our society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, how can we make books more compatible with a democratic society? I propose that instead of giving authors tax deductions, they might receive a certain percent of their expenses paid back to them by the government, capped at $100, and that books with fewer than 150 pages should be banned. Are books democratically required? I am not prepared to answer this question affirmatively, for a democratic government has multiple mechanisms to cultivate pluralism and foster discovery. But I have shown that books are certainly democratically permissible.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Yeah, okay, that was weird.</p>
<p>But I put the blame squarely on the hands of Rob Reich, author of <i>Just Giving</i>. The structure, arguments, and most of the individual sentences are his, not mine. I just changed the word &#8220;charity&#8221; to &#8220;books&#8221;, and replaced all the charity-related examples with book-related examples. A few parts were edited slightly to make them flow together better, and a few sentences are entirely my own, summarizing parts of the argument that wouldn&#8217;t fit into a short blog post. </p>
<p>I wrote this weird edited pastiche/summary because I couldn&#8217;t figure out how else to express my frustration at <i>Just Giving</i>. The book does not conclude that philanthropy is bad. In the end, it comes out saying that philanthropy is potentially okay and can serve a useful purpose, although the tax incentives around it are weird and should be structured better. But along the way it manages to <i>darkly hint</i> that philanthropy is bad about two hundred times on every page. Nothing in the book is <i>wrong</i>. But a lot of the right things in it are fully general counterarguments that demand charity <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/">display a level of rigor that nothing else has</A>. And the author&#8217;s interviews and summaries mostly keep the dark hinting while watering down the &#8220;actually it is okay&#8221; part so much it becomes almost invisible. The resulting style could be used to condemn not just charity but any productive human activity, including the writing of <i>Just Giving</i> itself.</p>
<p>For example: charity is not just an activity that takes place in a void. It takes place in a human society. So far, so good &#8211; nothing takes place in a void, except maybe space travel. But the book manages to darkly hint that because this is true, any regulation on it is justified. It never <i>says</i> this. In the end it doesn&#8217;t even want to regulate charity. But if you started feeling creeped out by sentences above like &#8220;books should not be understood in the simplistic manner of an activity that takes place within a framework of nonintervention by the state, or as nothing more than private individual decisions to express thoughts&#8221; or &#8220;writing a mediocre book squanders assets that are partially the public&#8217;s&#8221; &#8211; if you started thinking &#8220;Wait, is he pushing totalitarianism?&#8221; &#8211; well, both of those are pretty direct quotes from <i>Just Giving</i>, and the originals gave me the same level of unease about charity.</p>
<p>Or: it&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a sense in which if the state gives someone a tax deduction for something, it is subsidizing their activity. And it&#8217;s true that authors can deduct some of their book-writing expenses from their tax bill. But it seems troubling to go from there to calling book-writing &#8220;part of the submerged state, obscured from public view and accountability&#8221;, or to say that now &#8220;the state is partially complicit in the harm caused by bad books&#8221;. Yet both of these are real <i>Just Giving</i> sentences too. I find myself much less attached to the tax deduction for authors&#8217; business expenses (which may or may not be useful, no strong opinions) than to the project of preventing people from saying things like &#8220;Making sure books are good is kind of the responsibility of the state, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or: it&#8217;s true that authors just write whatever they want. You could describe this as making them &#8220;unaccountable and nontransparent&#8221;, and &#8220;at odds with democracy&#8221;. But at some point you might think things like &#8220;Wait a second, isn&#8217;t democracy perfectly compatible with private individuals doing their own thing? Are you <i>sure</i> you&#8217;re not thinking of totalitarianism?&#8221; Normally I would add something like &#8220;&#8230;and these considerations become immediately apparently when we&#8217;re talking about writing books, which makes this a classic case of <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/">proving too much</A>&#8220;, except that to me they <i>also</i> become immediately apparent when we&#8217;re talking about philanthropy, so there must just be some fundamental disconnect going on here.</p>
<p>In a few sections, I &#8220;cheated&#8221; by using <i>Just Giving</i>&#8216;s sentences or paragraphs about charitable foundations, rather than philanthropy in general. Reich is not necessarily worried about every charitable donation making &#8220;the dead hand of the donor potentially [extend] from beyond the grave to strangle future generations&#8221; (yes, this is a real quotation from the book), only about donations from foundations doing that. Still, might this be a little dramatic? Reich treats it as self-evident that permanent foundations are bizarre, maybe literally the <i>most</i> bizarre thing, quoting John Stuart Mill&#8217;s opinion that charitable foundations are &#8220;among the grossest and most conspicuous abuses of the time&#8221; and that the necessity of banning foundations that outlast their founder&#8217;s lifetime is &#8220;so obvious that he can scarcely conceive how any earnest inquirer could think otherwise&#8221;. Unfortunately for Mill, this is not at all obvious to me, and I was left baffled on this point which the book kind of assumed to be a natural human instinct. Why should my ability to control my donations be limited by something as random as my lifespan? If Bill Gates happens to get hit by a truck tomorrow, does this coincidence have some sort of important moral bearing on how the Gates Foundation&#8217;s money should be spent? If we decree it does, this leads to odd conclusions, like that the most important effective altruist cause in the world is encasing Bill Gates in an impenetrable steel shell so that nothing can possibly harm him &#8211; do we endorse this use of resources? If we oppose foundations, is Bill Gates still allowed to leave all his money to the single person in the world most aligned with his values, and then hope really hard that this person doesn&#8217;t betray him? Isn&#8217;t part of the point of law to abstract out things like &#8220;people might betray you&#8221; and replace them with comfortable ironclad contracts?</p>
<p>(a confession: my point about books being a perpetual exercise of the author&#8217;s power in the same way foundations are a perpetual exercise of the founder&#8217;s power is unfair, and addressed by Reich in the book. He states that most permanent things wield power only as long as the living choose to humor them &#8211; eg a dead author only matters if living people choose to read them and take their advice to heart &#8211; but foundations do not need the support of the living as long as the contracts that create them remain enforced).</p>
<p>There is much to like about <i>Just Giving</i>. Its breakdown of where charitable dollars actually go (mostly to religious institutions if you&#8217;re poor, mostly to colleges and museums if you&#8217;re rich) contains data I&#8217;ve been looking for a long time, and rightly points out that we should do better. Its discussion of the way tax deductions interact with wealth is interesting, although not obviously more applicable to charity than to book-writing or anything else. Its conclusion &#8211; that charity and philanthropic foundations have an important role in diversifying the range of represented interests and experimenting with new social policy &#8211; seems dead right, and matches <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/29/against-against-billionaire-philanthropy/">my own thoughts</A> on the subject (and see also <A HREF="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/17/20754970/billionaire-philanthropy-reproductive-health-care-politics">this article</A> by Kelsey Piper). I really can&#8217;t disagree with this book too much on the object level.</p>
<p>And yet if my review sounds scathing, I hope this is a sort of justice. Rob Reich has limited disagreements with charity on the object level, but still manages to write what sounds like a scathing review of it. I think this is bad.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <i>Just Giving</i> is a government-subsidized exercise of plutocratic power and plutocratic voice repugnant to the very idea of a democratic society of equals. I hope this gets corrected in any future editions.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Is anyone here an oncologist or orthopaedic surgeon who feels competent to answer some hard questions about pareosteal osteosarcoma, for a smart good person who will not misinterpret you or treat you as official medical advice? If so, please get in touch with me at scott[at]slatestarcodex[dot]com so I can connect you with a friend of mine who needs some help. They already have a doctor and are on track to get good care, they just want to get clarification on some of the evidence base around which treatments are best.</p>

<p>California recently passed a law saying that all corporate boards need to be gender-balanced. A recent study finds that <A HREF="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092911991930375X">affected firms underperformed expectations</A> as investors reacted negatively to them having to hire female board members less qualified than the male candidates they replaced. The paper says that &#8220;a back of the envelope calculation provides a total loss in value in excess of $60 billion&#8221;, which would mean this single bill wiped out an amount of value equal to the total GDP of North Dakota, or to the yearly <A HREF="https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2017/04/17/heres-how-much-bernie-sanders-free-college-for-all-plan-would-cost/37430393/">price tag</A> of Bernie Sanders&#8217; free-college-for-all plan.

<p>Mark Twain&#8217;s last universally accepted work was his autobiography, concluded just before his death in 1910. But in 1917, two spiritualist mediums claimed that Twain&#8217;s ghost had dictated them a novel via Ouija Board. The book, called <i><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jap_Herron">Jap Herron</A></i>, got generally poor reviews: the <i>New York Times</i> wrote that &#8220;if this is the best that &#8216;Mark Twain&#8217; can do by reaching across the barrier, the army of admirers that his works have won for him will all hope that he will hereafter respect that boundary.&#8221; It is more famous for <A HREF="https://splinternews.com/how-mark-twains-ghost-almost-set-off-the-copyright-batt-1793855099">the ensuing legal case</A>. The Twain estate sued the publishers and trapped them in a double-bind: if the book was a fraud, they needed to cease publication; if real, they needed to pay royalties to Twain&#8217;s heirs!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d previously heard bad things about Narendra Modi, but assumed it was the usual panic about any right-wing foreign leader. <A HREF="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india">This article</A> changed my mind. I now think that he didn&#8217;t just fail at preventing deadly anti-Muslim riots in his home state but actively helped organize them, that he organizes the intimidation and sometimes murder of journalists who investigate him and judges who rule against him, and that he&#8217;s created a climate of intimidation that makes Indians afraid to share negative information about him. And his chosen counter-narrative &#8211; that at least he makes the trains run on time &#8211; is probably false &#8211; the superb economic growth statistics that have marked his administration <A HREF="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/view-modis-suspect-gdp-numbers-have-done-real-damage/articleshow/69782308.cms?from=mdr">seem to have been faked</A>. I think in general &#8220;this guy has a reign of terror and people are afraid to speak out against him, but at least all the official numbers show things are going well&#8221; should sound suspicious. Overall Modi and Erdogan scare me the most of any world leaders, because they show a path by which a democracy can slowly become dictatorial without a clear line where everyone unites and stops it.</p>

<p><A HREF="https://amp.businessinsider.com/german-supreme-court-adopts-basic-income-policy-2019-12">Germany guarantees unemployed citizens around $330 per month indefinitely. The policy looks a little like basic income.</A> I like basic income, but the way this got done was kind of sad. German law says that citizens can get unemployment benefits indefinitely, but only as long as they are trying hard to get a job. A man on benefits wanted to turn down jobs that were offered to him if they weren&#8217;t in his preferred field, and sued the state saying he should be allowed to do that. The Supreme Court agreed and said it was unconstitutional for Germany to require that people on unemployment be looking for jobs. I guess I always hoped UBI would come from a widespread utopian desire to free people from the drudgery of work, and not from judicial activism without broad-based support, but I guess I&#8217;ll see where this goes.</p>
<p>Mark Ledwich published a recent study showing that <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11211.pdf">YouTube&#8217;s algorithm is not radicalizing people</A> (though many commenters noted that it&#8217;s been improved since 2017, and maybe it was radicalizing people then). Now he&#8217;s published <A HREF="https://medium.com/@markoledwich/youtube-radicalization-an-authoritative-saucy-story-28f73953ed17">a very strong polemic</A> arguing the same, and lambasting what he considers the echo chamber that ever made people believe otherwise. I find this a really interesting ethics-of-scientific-communication case, because although it&#8217;s a great article, he seems to be so intensely passionate about this issue that I have trouble believing he is the best person to conduct studies about it. But surely it&#8217;s wrong to say scientists should never write passionate polemics arguing for what they believe &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t want to keep climatologists out of the debate around global warming, for example. I&#8217;m not really sure what to think about this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following the debate about whether the media is undercovering Bernie Sanders for a while.

<p><A HREF="https://blog.aragon.org/juror-pre-activation-guide/">Aragon</A> is a court system on the blockchain. I know, I know, everything on the blockchain is a scam. But this actually has a certain elegance to it &#8211; it works as a Keynesian beauty contest. &#8220;Jurors are not asked to rule impartially on disputes but instead are asked to rule the way they expect other jurors to rule. I think the idea is that the correct verdict (or what a reasonable person would interpret as the correct verdict, which in a well-functioning legal system should be the same) forms a Schelling point that everyone is supposed to converge upon. I assume somebody has thought about all the ways this could possibly go wrong and is trying to prevent them? In any case, it&#8217;s interesting purely as a statement of legal philosophy and mechanism design.</p>

<p>When I was young, my dentist told me to read <i>The China Study</i> to learn about healthy eating. I never got around to it, which turns out to be a good thing.

<p>NPR: <A HREF="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/01/615188051/lets-stop-talking-about-the-30-million-word-gap">Let&#8217;s Stop Talking About The 30 Million Word Gap</A>. Remember the research showing that poor people (or black people) hear fewer words from their parents as children, and that&#8217;s why they fall behind in school? It <A HREF="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cdev.13072">failed</A> <A HREF="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0169">replication</A>. This is also an interesting study in narrative construction. When everyone believed in the word gap, it was framed as an argument for progressive ideas &#8211; &#8220;maybe you think poor/black people&#8217;s problems are their own fault, but actually the odds were stacked against them because of a childhood word gap, so we should be more willing to admit blame for poverty and fund social services&#8221; (<A HREF="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/">example</A>). Now that the word gap&#8217;s been proven false, its falsehood is an argument supporting progressive ideas- &#8220;maybe you think we don&#8217;t need to examine structural inequality because the only problem is a word gap, but that&#8217;s been debunked and is just racist victim-blaming, so we should be more willing to admit blame for poverty and fund social services.&#8221; (<A HREF="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/09/15/no-record-players-wont-solve-inequality/">example</A>). The science did a 180, but the political implications stayed exactly the same. And this beats the alternative &#8211; without this sleight-of-hand, the scientific consensus wouldn&#8217;t have been allowed to switch sides anywhere that ordinary people might hear about it.</p>

					<div class="pjgm-postcontent">
				<p>I worry my sleep quality isn&#8217;t great. On weekends, no matter when I go to bed, I sleep until 11 or 12. When I wake up, I feel like I&#8217;ve overslept. But if I try to make myself get up earlier, I feel angry and want to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>A supplement company I trust, Nootropics Depot, recently released a new product called Sleep Support. It advertises that, along with helping you fall asleep faster, it can &#8220;improve sleep quality&#8221; by &#8220;improv[ing] sleep architecture, allowing you to achieve higher quality and more refreshing sleep.&#8221; I decided to try it.</p>
<p>The first night I took it, I woke up naturally at 9 the next morning, with no desire to go back to sleep. This has <i>never happened before</i>. It <i>shocked</i> me. And the next morning, <i>the same thing happened</i>. I started recommending the supplement to all my friends, some of whom also reported good results.</p>
<p>I decided the next step was to do a randomized controlled trial. I obtained sugar pills, and put both the sugar pills and the Sleep Support pills inside bigger capsules so I couldn&#8217;t tell which was which. The recommended dose was two Sleep Support pills per night, so for my 24 night trial I created 12 groups of two Sleep Support pills and 12 groups of two placebo pills. </p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/sleep_setup2.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Then I asked a friend to flip a coin 24 times, and depending on the result place either a pair of Sleep Support pills or a pair of placebo pills in each slot of a monthly pill planner, and record which slot contained which pills on a secret piece of paper I could see at the end of the experiment. Then every weekend night for three months I took the next pair of pills in the planner and recorded:</p>
<p>&#8211; the time I went to bed<br />
&#8211; the time I woke up<br />
&#8211; my subjective rating of how well-rested I was upon waking<br />
&#8211; my subjective rating of how much energy I felt like I&#8217;d had that day<br />
&#8211; my subjective rating of how vivid my dreams were that night<br />
&#8211; my subjective guess about whether I&#8217;d taken placebo or experimental that night</p>
<p>The time I went to bed wasn&#8217;t intended to be a dependent variable; I generally took the pills just before going to bed, so they couldn&#8217;t affect that. And I had no way of measuring what time I went to sleep. It was just so that I could measure my total time in bed that night.</p>
<p>The time I woke up was the hardest to operationalize. Usually I wake up a few times in the morning, groggily check the clock, and decide to go back to bed, then wake up for good once it becomes so late I start feeling guilty about how much of the day I&#8217;m wasting. I considered setting wake-up time as the very first time I woke up to check the clock, but sometimes I wake up at 5 AM to go to the bathroom, and I didn&#8217;t want that to get recorded as me &#8220;waking up&#8221; at 5 AM. And if I used a cutoff like &#8220;the first time I wake up after 7&#8221;, then a night I wake up at 6:59 and go back to bed and wake up for good at 11 would get recorded completely differently from a night I wake up at 7:01 and go back to bed and wake up for good at 11. But if I defined wake-up time as the time I finally woke up for good, then it would be too easy for me to subconsciously bias the experiment. &#8220;This feels like a night I took placebo, better stay in bed until at least 11:30&#8221;. </p>
<p>I decided to eliminate the whole problem by forbidding myself to check the clock while in bed. I would go to sleep, wake up, either decide to go back to sleep or not, and I wasn&#8217;t allowed to check the clock until I had gotten out of bed and gotten dressed.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the headline results of the experiment &#8211; number of hours I slept during experimental vs. control nights, and wake up time during experimental vs. control nights</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/sleep12.png"> <IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/sleep22.png"></center></p>
<p>On average there was no difference between the two groups on either measurement. There was also no difference on any of the subjective measures. My subjective guess about whether I&#8217;d taken experimental or placebo capsules that night had no correlation with the reality.</p>
<p>My conclusion isn&#8217;t that Sleep Support doesn&#8217;t work; I didn&#8217;t even try it for its main indication of helping with insomnia. My study was too underpowered to detect even medium-sized effects. And just because it didn&#8217;t work for me doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t work for somebody else.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the effect I thought that <i>I</i> observed &#8211; a consistent change of two hours in my otherwise stable wake-up time &#8211; wasn&#8217;t real. This shocked me. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>I think my original strategy of &#8220;wake up a few times in the morning, check the clock, and finally get out of bed when you really feel like it&#8221; is very susceptible to the placebo effect. Usually I might wake up at 9, decide that was too early to face the world, and go back to bed. Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t even remember doing this. Part of this was probably inertia &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t used to getting up at 9, I figured I must not have gotten enough sleep to feel good, and so I didn&#8217;t want to do it today. Once I had an exciting new sleep supplement in my system, I woke up at 9, actually checked whether or not I felt ready to wake up, and absent my usual prior that I wasn&#8217;t, I found that I was, and woke up.</p>
<p>This hypothesis is supported by the results of the experiment. On about a third of days, I woke up before 10 &#8211; again, something I never would have done before starting Sleep Support. I think the active ingredient here was not letting myself look at the clock. Without external cues to tell me how tired I <i>should</i> feel, I was forced to rely on how tired I actually felt, which in many cases was &#8220;not tired at all&#8221;. This happened regardless of whether I was taking Sleep Support or placebo that day.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though the supplement failed to differentiate itself from placebo, I think this is one of the most successful biohacking experiments I&#8217;ve ever done. I&#8217;m getting up on average an hour or so earlier than I did before, getting more done, and not feeling any more tired by the evening.</p>
<p>Future research: see if this keeps working even now that I know what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>You can download my raw data <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/sleep_experiment.xlsx">here</A>. If you want to replicate this experiment, you can buy Sleep Support capsules <A HREF="https://nootropicsdepot.com/sleep-support-capsules-natural-sleep-aid/">here</A>. There are lots of ways to make a placebo; I found <A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q846DDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=slatestarcode-20&#038;linkId=7cde26b92cd22596c60c06aed7a5079f&#038;language=en_US">these</A> very large empty capsules helpful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in hearing about anyone else&#8217;s experience conducting controlled trials of supplements on themselves; if you do something like this and want to publish it on a blog, let me know.</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/14/addendum-to-targeting-meritocracy/" title="4:18 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">February 14, 2020</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/" title="View all posts by Scott Alexander">Scott Alexander</a></span>			</div><!-- .pjgm-postmeta -->

					<div class="pjgm-postcontent">
				<p>I&#8217;ve always been dissatisfied with <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/24/targeting-meritocracy/">Targeting Meritocracy</A> and the <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/25/highlights-from-the-comment-thread-on-meritocracy/">comments</A> it got. My position seemed so obvious to me &#8211; and the opposite position so obvious to other people &#8211; that we both had to be missing something.</p>
<p>Reading it over, I think I was missing the idea of <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/">conflict vs mistake theory</A>.</p>
<p>I wrote the post from a mistake theory perspective. The government exists to figure out how to solve problems. Good government officials are the ones who can figure out solutions and implement them effectively. That means we want people who are smart and competent. Since meritocracy means promoting the smartest and most competent people, it is tautologically correct. The only conceivable problem is if we make mistakes in judging intelligence and competence, which is what I spend the rest of the post worrying about.</p>
<p>From a conflict theory perspective, this is bunk. Good government officials are ones who serve <i>our</i> class interests and not <i>their</i> class interests. At best, merit is uncorrelated with this. At worst, <i>we</i> are the lower and middle class, <i>they</i> are the upper class, and there is some system in place (eg Ivy League universities) that disproportionately funnels the most meritorious people into the upper class. Then when we put the most meritorious people in government, we are necessarily seeding the government with upper class people who serve upper class interests.</p>
<p>This resolves my confusion about why people disagree with me on this point. It reinforces a lesson I&#8217;ve had to learn again and again: if people seem slightly stupid, they&#8217;re probably just stupid. But if they seem colossally and inexplicably stupid, you probably differ in some kind of basic assumption so fundamental that you didn&#8217;t realize you were assuming it, and should poke at the issue until you figure it out.</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/12/confirmation-bias-as-misfire-of-normal-bayesian-reasoning/" title="11:15 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">February 12, 2020</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/" title="View all posts by Scott Alexander">Scott Alexander</a></span>			</div><!-- .pjgm-postmeta -->

				<p>From the subreddit: <A HREF="https://www.fastcompany.com/90458795/humans-are-hardwired-to-dismiss-facts-that-dont-fit-their-worldview">Humans Are Hardwired To Dismiss Facts That Don&#8217;t Fit Their Worldview</A>. Once you get through the preliminary Trump supporter and anti-vaxxer denunciations, it turns out to be an attempt at an evo psych explanation of confirmation bias:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our ancestors evolved in small groups, where cooperation and persuasion had at least as much to do with reproductive success as holding accurate factual beliefs about the world. Assimilation into one’s tribe required assimilation into the group’s ideological belief system. An instinctive bias in favor of one’s in-group” and its worldview is deeply ingrained in human psychology.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the article as a whole makes good points, but I&#8217;m increasingly uncertain that confirmation bias can be separated from normal reasoning.</p>
<p>Suppose that one of my friends says she saw a coyote walk by her house in Berkeley. I know there are coyotes in the hills outside Berkeley, so I am not too surprised; I believe her.</p>
<p>Now suppose that same friend says she saw a polar bear walk by her house. I assume she is mistaken, lying, or hallucinating.</p>
<p>Is this confirmation bias? It sure sounds like it. When someone says something that confirms my preexisting beliefs (eg &#8216;coyotes live in this area, but not polar bears&#8217;), I believe it. If that same person provides the same evidence for something that challenges my preexisting beliefs, I reject it. What am I doing differently from an anti-vaxxer who rejects any information that challenges her preexisting beliefs (eg that vaccines cause autism)?</p>
<p>When new evidence challenges our established priors (eg a friend reports a polar bear, but I have a strong prior that there are no polar bears around), we ought to heavily discount the evidence <i>and</i> slightly shift our prior. So I should end up believing that my friend is probably wrong, but I should also be slightly less confident in my assertion that there are no polar bears loose in Berkeley today. This seems sufficient to explain confirmation bias, ie a tendency to stick to what we already believe and reject evidence against it.</p>
<p>The anti-vaxxer is still doing something wrong; she somehow managed to get a very strong prior on a false statement, and isn&#8217;t weighing the new evidence heavily enough. But I think it&#8217;s important to note that she&#8217;s attempting to carry out normal reasoning, and failing, rather than carrying out some special kind of reasoning called &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are some important refinements to make to this model &#8211; maybe <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/">there&#8217;s a special &#8220;emotional reasoning&#8221; that locks down priors more tightly</A>, and maybe <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/">people naturally overweight priors because that was adaptive in the ancestral environment</A>. Maybe after you add these refinements, you end up at exactly the traditional model of confirmation bias (and the one the Fast Company article is using) and my objection becomes kind of pointless.</p>
<p>But not completely pointless. I still think it&#8217;s helpful to approach confirmation bias by thinking of it as a normal form of reasoning, and then asking under what conditions it fails.</p>

				<p>Hello to all the new readers I&#8217;ve gotten from, uh, Paul Watson of Infowars. Before anything else, consider reading <A HREF="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/safety-effectiveness.html">this statement by the CDC about vaccines</A>.</p>
<p>Still here? Fine. </p>
<p>Infowars linked here with the headline <A HREF="https://www.infowars.com/survey-finds-people-who-identify-as-left-wing-more-likely-to-have-been-diagnosed-with-a-mental-illness/">Survey Finds People Who Identify As Left Wing More Likely To Have Been Diagnosed With A Mental Illness</A>. This is accurate only insofar as the result uses the publicly available data I provide. The claim about mental illness was made by Twitter user <A HREF="https://twitter.com/phl43">Philippe Lemoine</A> and not by me. In general, if a third party analyzes SSC survey data, I would prefer that media sources reporting on their analysis attribute it to them, and not to SSC.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Lemoine&#8217;s analysis is accurate enough, but needs some clarifications:</p>
<p>1. Both extreme rightists and extreme leftists are more likely than moderates to have been diagnosed with most conditions.</p>
<p>2. Leftists might be more likely to trust the psychiatric system and get diagnosed. My survey shows some signs of that. Liberals are 60% more likely than conservatives to have formal diagnoses of depression, but only 30% more likely to have a self-diagnosis of depression.</p>
<p>3. Leftists might be more likely to think of their issues through a psychiatric lens than rightists, meaning that even the self-diagnosis numbers might be inflated.</p>
<p>4. The SSC survey is a bad sample to use for this, not just because it&#8217;s unrepresentative, but because it might be unrepresentative of different political affiliations in different ways. For example, SSC Marxists really are surprisingly depressed, but maybe the only Marxists who would read an anti-Marxist blog are depressed Marxists looking for things to be miserable and angry about (though see below for some counterevidence).</p>
<p>5. A commenter on Lemoine&#8217;s tweet links to <A HREF="https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2007/07/4th-makes-me-think-of-politics-and.html">this blog post</A> by someone who found the same thing in the General Social Survey. The General Social Survey is much larger and more rigorous than my survey, and there&#8217;s no reason to care what my survey has to say when there are GSS results available.</p>
<p>In general, if a survey analysis is posted on this blog, it&#8217;s mine. If not, then it isn&#8217;t mine and you should link to whoever performed it and let them clean up their own mess. Thanks &#8211; and seriously, <A HREF="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171129131400.htm">vaccines are fine</A>.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Autogynephilia&#8221; means becoming aroused by imagining yourself as a woman. &#8220;Autoandrophilia&#8221; means becoming aroused by imagining yourself as a man. There&#8217;s no term that describes both, but we need one, so let&#8217;s say autogenderphilia.</p>
<p>These conditions are famous mostly because a few sexologists, especially Ray Blanchard and Michael Bailey, speculate that they are the most common cause of transgender. They point to studies showing most trans women endorse autogynephilia. Most trans people disagree with this theory, sometimes very strongly, and accuse it of reducing transgender to a fetish.</p>
<p>Without wading into the moral issues around it, I thought it would be interesting to get data from the SSC survey. The following comes partly from my own analyses and partly from wulfrickson&#8217;s <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/et039t/independent_ssc_survey_analysis_autogynephilia/?_branch_match_id=467182258828649476">look at the public survey data</A> on r/TheMotte.</p>
<p>The survey asked the following questions:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/autophilia.png"></center></p>
<p>First of all, thanks to the 6,715 people (182 trans, 6259 cis, 274 confused) who answered these questions despite my disclaimers. Here&#8217;s how it worked out. 5 is maximally autogenderphilic, 1 is no autogenderphilia at all:</p>

<p></center><font size="1"><i>*sexual orientation was self-reported. Almost all transgender people report sexual orientation relative to their current gender rather than their birth gender, so for example a &#8220;lesbian trans woman&#8221; would be someone who grew up male, currently identifies as female, and is attracted to other women. This is the opposite of how Blanchard and Bailey sometimes use these terms, so be careful comparing these results to theirs!<br />
**results are marked as ??? for groups with sample size lower than 20</i></font></p>
<p>The survey confirmed Blanchard and Bailey&#8217;s finding that many lesbian trans women had strong autogynephilia. But it also confirmed <A HREF="https://surveyanon.wordpress.com/2017/12/07/on-autogynephilia-in-cis-women/">other people&#8217;s findings</A> that many cis people also have strong autogenderphilia. In this dataset, autogenderphilia rates in gay cis men were equal to those in lesbian trans women.</p>
<p>Autogenderphilia in cis people was divided between fantasies about being the opposite gender, and fantasies about being the gender they already were. What does it mean to fantasize about being a gender you already are? I asked a cis female friend who admitted to autogynephilia. She told me:</p>
<blockquote><p>My literal body is arousing &#8211; it&#8217;s hot that I have breasts and can get pregnant and have a curvy figure and a feminine face and long hair, and it&#8217;s hot to dress up in femme clothes. There are certain gendered/social interactions that are very hot, or that can easily springboard into ones that are very hot. I&#8217;ve honestly wondered whether I might not be nonbinary or trans male, because I&#8217;m not really sure how euphoric being female is, besides that it&#8217;s like living in a sex fantasy.</p></blockquote>
<p>(score one for the hypothesis that this kind of thing causes gender transition, because after reading this <i>I</i> kind of want to be a woman.)</p>
<p>Uh&#8230;moving on. The highest rates of autogenderphilia were found in bi cis men (autoandrophilia), gay cis men (autoandrophilia), bi trans women (autogynephilia), and lesbian trans women (autogynephilia).</p>
<p>These groups all have three things in common: they identify as the gender involved, they are attracted to the gender involved, and they are biologically male. </p>
<p>I would guess biological men have more of every fetish, regardless of their current gender identity, so it&#8217;s not surprising that they have more autogenderphilia also. In fact, we see that in biological women, the two highest categories are bi cis women (autogynephilia), and lesbian cis women (autogynephilia); again, they identify as the gender involved, and they are attracted to the gender involved.</p>
<p>So abstracting that away, the SSC survey data suggest a very boring hypothesis of autogenderphilia: if you identify as a gender, and you&#8217;re attracted to that gender, it&#8217;s a natural leap to be attracted to yourself being that gender. </p>
<p>The SSC survey hypothesis explains the same evidence that Blanchard and Bailey&#8217;s hypothesis explains (that lesbian trans women very often have autogynephilic fantasies), but reverse the proposed causation: it&#8217;s not that autogynephilia causes gender transition; it&#8217;s that identification as a gender is one factor that causes autogenderphilia. </p>
<p>But after that, it can go on to explain other things that Blanchard and Bailey can&#8217;t explain, like why cis gay men have as much autoandrophilia as trans lesbian women have autogynephilia. Or why some people with low levels of autogenderphilia transition, but many people with high levels don&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s a simpler and more defensible explanation of the evidence. </p>
<p>I asked some people I know who supported Blanchard and Bailey&#8217;s theory for their thoughts. They focused on a few concerns about the data.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, weird Internet samples plausibly have more of every paraphilia. This might inflate the <i>rate for</i> cis gay men and the <i>number of</i> trans lesbian women, assuming the latter all had to be above some cutoff; that might falsely lead me to believe the two groups have the same rate.</p>
<p>One counterargument might be that the responses among cis people alone are enough to generate the hypothesis discussed above. The low rates of autogynephilia in gay men, compared to in straight and bi men, suggest that being attracted to a gender is a prerequisite of autogenderphilia to it. And (adjusting again for the general tendency of male-bodied people to have more fetishes) the higher rates of autogynephilia in cis women/autoandrophilia in cis men, compared to autoandrophilia in cis women/autogynephilia in cis men, suggest that identifying as a gender is a prequisite to autogenderphilia to it.</p>
<p>Another counterargument might be the similarity of the histograms produced by cis gay male and trans lesbian female responses; they don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re being generated by two different processes which have only coincidentally averaged out into the same summary statistic:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/autophilia4.png"></center></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look like all cis men over a certain cutoff are becoming trans women; it looks like the curve for cis gay men and trans lesbian women are being shaped by the same process.</p>
<p><u>Second</u>, did the survey questions accurately capture autogenderphilia? Fetishes range from very mild to very extreme; some people like being slapped during sex, other people have whole BDSM dungeons in their basement. Is it possible the survey captured some boring meaning of autogenderphilia, like &#8220;sure, I guess it would be hot to be a woman&#8221;, but some people have a much stronger and more obsessive form? The histogram above argues against this a little, but there might be ceiling effects.</p>
<p>Alice Dreger seems to take something like this perspective here:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Q: Do you think autogynephilia might be a part of the female experience, trans or cis? I&#8217;ve seen some (very preliminary) theorizing about it as well as a paper with a tiny sample size that suggest that cis women also experience sexual arousal at the thought of themselves as women.</b></p>
<p>A: I’ve talked with Blanchard, Bailey, and also Anne Lawrence about this, and my impression is they all doubt cis (non-transgender) women experience sexual arousal at the thought of themselves as women. Clinically, Blanchard observed autogynephilic natal male individuals who were aroused, for example, at the ideas of using a tampon for menses or knitting as a woman with other women. I have never heard a natal woman express sexual arousal at such ideas. I’ve never heard of a natal woman masturbating to such thoughts.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked the same cis female friend who gave me the quotation above, and she described using a tampon to masturbate and finding it hot. I think Dreger makes an important point that there are some pretty unusual manifestations of autogenderphilic fetishes out there and we should hesitate before drawing too many conclusions from a single question that lumps them all together. But also, Alice Dreger seems like an really dignified and important person who probably doesn&#8217;t hang out with people who talk openly about their menstruation-related masturbation fantasies, and she should probably adjust for that. Maybe she could move to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a common failure mode in psychiatry, where we notice people with some condition doing some weird thing, and fail to notice that huge swathes of people without the condition do the exact same weird thing. For example, everyone knows schizophrenics hear voices, but until recently nobody realized that <A HREF="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/longing-nostalgia/201803/research-is-shedding-new-light-hearing-voices">something like 20%</A> of healthy people do too. Everyone knows that LSD users can end up with permanent visual hallucinations, but until recently nobody realized that <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/11/lots-of-people-going-around-with-mild-hallucinations-all-the-time/">lots of drug-free people have the same problem</A>. Schizophrenics definitely hear <i>more</i> voices than healthy people, and LSD users have <i>more</i> permanent visual hallucinations, but it&#8217;s movement along the distribution rather than a completely novel phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think autogenderphilia is turning out to work the same way, and that this will require us to reassess the way we think about it.</p>
<p>As usual, I welcome people trying to replicate or expand on these results. All of the data used in this post are freely available and can be downloaded <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/20/ssc-survey-results-2020/">here</A>. I&#8217;ve also heard Michael Bailey is going to release his own interpretation of these data, so stay tuned for that. I&#8217;d like to delve into these issues further on future surveys, so let me know if you have ideas about how to do that.</p>
<p>And a big thanks to Tailcalled for helping me set up this section of the survey.

<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>Guyana has the highest national suicide rate in the world, 30 people per year per 100,000. Guyana has poverty and crime and those things, but no more so than neighboring Brazil (suicide rate of 6) or Venezuela (suicide rate of 4). What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>One place to start: Guyana is a multi-ethnic country. Is its sky-high suicide rate focused in one ethnic group? The first answer I found was <A HREF="https://www.stabroeknews.com/2017/01/03/features/in-the-diaspora/suicide-race-guyana-not-live-single-issue-lives/">this article</A> by a social justice warrior telling us it constitutes racial &#8220;essentialism&#8221; to even ask the question. But in the process of telling us exactly what kind of claims we should avoid, she mentions someone bringing up that &#8220;80% of the reported suicides are carried out by Indo-Guyanese&#8221;. I feel like one of those classicists who has reconstructed a lost heresy through hostile quotations in Irenaeus.</p>
<p>Indo-Guyanese aren&#8217;t American Indians; they&#8217;re from actual India. Apparently thousands of Indians immigrated to Guyana as indentured laborers in the late 1800s. Most went to Guyana, and somewhat fewer went to neighboring Suriname. Suriname also has a sky-high suicide rate, but slightly less than Guyana&#8217;s, to the exact degree that its Indian population is slightly less than Guyana&#8217;s. Basically no Indians went anywhere else in South America, and nowhere else in South America has anywhere near the suicide rate of these two countries. The most Indian regions of Guyana also have <A HREF="https://guyanatimesgy.com/suicide-and-culture/">the highest suicide rate</A>. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Does India itself have high suicide rates? On average, yes. But India has a lot of weird suicide microclimates. Statewide rates <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_India#Statistics">range</A> from from 38 in Sikkim (higher than any country in the world) to 0.5 in Bihar (lower than any country in the world except Barbados). Indo-Guyanese mostly come from Bihar and other low-suicide regions. While I can&#8217;t rule out that the Indo-Guyanese come from some micro-micro-climate of higher suicidality, <A HREF="https://guyanatimesgy.com/suicide-and-culture/">this guy</A> claims to have traced them back to some of their ancestral villages and found that those villages have low suicide rates.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on? <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=TDwlDwAAQBAJ&#038;pg=PA125&#038;lpg=PA125&#038;dq=hindu+diaspora+suicide+rates&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=58i8B4cVtF&#038;sig=ACfU3U26ceXx3hqzcni4ixLZLXgK4yBWww&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiK_8bSnLfnAhW7JzQIHfJiDs8Q6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&#038;q=hindu%20diaspora%20suicide%20rates&#038;f=false">Social and Cultural Dimensions of Indian Indentured Labour and Its Diaspora</A> argues that despite the mixed suicide rates in India itself, rates across the Indian Diaspora are universally high. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fiji Indian suicide rate in the period 1900 to 1915 was the highest among all Indian labour importing colonies in Africa and the West Indies, and much higher than in India itself. In Mauritius too, hundreds of indentured Indian laborers committed suicide by jumping from a particular hillock during the indenture period, which acquired the name of &#8216;Suicide Hill&#8217;, now turned into a monument [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In his article &#8216;Veil of Dishonor&#8217; Lal (1985) describes what officials tend to point out as the primary cause of the Fiji Indian suicides: sexual jealousy arising from the persistent shortage of women on the plantations. The rate of indentured adult Indian females to males in Fiji was only 43 to 100. The intense competition for women among the indentured men was seen as the main reason for male suicides in Fiji. Lomarsh Roopnarine (2007) also shows high rates of suicides among indentured Indians in British Guiana [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Although there is no reason to doubt the existence of sexual jealousy, this emphasis on the scarcity of women disregards the arduous circumstances in which the indentured labourers were working, and the disruption of the &#8220;integrative institutions&#8221; of society &#8211; family, marriage, caste, kinship, and religion &#8211; as the underlying causes of suicide and other ills affecting the Indian indentured labour population.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but arduous circumstances affected dozens of different ethnicities involved in various colonization and forced labor schemes, and most of them didn&#8217;t have these kinds of suicide rates. I can kind of imagine a story where first-generation laborers had no hope of settling down or raising families, committed suicide at high rates, and that ingrained suicidal tendencies in the culture that never went away. But then how come that didn&#8217;t happen to eg indentured Englishmen in Virginia?</p>
<p>The incongruously named <A HREF="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/0020764018777523">Vijayakumar and John</A> (2018) blame the Hindu religion.  Did you know that the <i>Ramayana</i> ends with Rama, three of brothers, and the entire population of his kingdom committing mass suicide by drowning? Or that the <i>mahaparasthana</i> is a traditional Hindu method of suicide &#8220;where the person walks in a north easterly direction, subsisting only on water and air, until his body sinks to rest&#8221;? Any religion that has a traditional direction to walk in while you&#8217;re committing suicide by starving yourself seems kind of suspicious here. But then how come Hindus in some parts of India have such low suicide rates? How come it&#8217;s just the diaspora that suffers. The paper suggests maybe it&#8217;s because religiosity plays a protective effect, but it sounds kind of strained.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have better answers to any of these questions. Maybe the combination of Hindu religion, imbalanced gender ratios, and uprooted communities created a perfect storm. I don&#8217;t have any better ideas.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Guyana, at 30 suicides per year per 100,000, is the highest <i>national</i> suicide rate in the world. But if Greenland ever wins independence, it will steal first place. Greenland&#8217;s suicide rate is 83 per year per 100,000, almost three times higher than any other country in the world.</p>
<p>Like Guyana, this is more ethnic than national. Greenland is mostly Inuit, and Inuit everywhere have equally high suicide rates. The suicide rate in the mostly-Inuit Canadian province of Nunavit <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_Canada">is 71</A> (for comparison, Canada in general is 10). The suicide rate among Alaskan Inuit is 40 (for comparison, the US in general is 14).</p>
<p>This definitely is <i>not</i> just because of the cold and darkness. White Alaskans who live right next to Alaskan natives have a rate of <A HREF="http://dhss.alaska.gov/SuicidePrevention/Pages/Statistics/aksuiciderate__bygenderrace.aspx">about 20</A>, not much higher than the US average. And suicide in Greenland &#8211; <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_effects_on_suicide_rates">like everywhere else</A> &#8211; peaks in the spring and summer anyway. </p>
<p>Most damning of all, Greenland&#8217;s high suicide rates are a recent phenomenon. In 1971, <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685778/">the rate was 4</A>. I didn&#8217;t forget a zero there. Fifty years ago, Greenland had one of the lowest suicide rates in the world. But by 1990, it had reached 120 (it&#8217;s since come down a little bit). What happened in those twenty years?</p>
<p>You would think limiting it to such a short time period would make things easy. It isn&#8217;t. There are two main theories: social alienation, and alcohol.</p>
<p>There is definitely a lot of social alienation. For centuries, the Inuit hunted seals in traditional villages. At some point the Danish government decided that was unacceptably backwards and resettled them in cities, especially the capital of Nuuk. This didn&#8217;t go well.</p>
<p>One counterargument to this story is that Nuuk has the lowest suicide rate in Greenland, and <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266058/">the more remote the village, the worse the suicide crisis</A>. Maybe you could argue that everywhere was modernized and disrupted and alienated but at least a big city has some interesting stuff to do. This would kind of match the American experience, where it&#8217;s small towns in West Virginia that are getting hit by the opioid crisis and deaths of despair.</p>
<p>Another counterargument is that all Native American communities suffered a lot of displacement and alienation and modernization, but none of them suffered the same suicide spike as the Inuit. Sources disagree on the exact Native American suicide rate in the US, but it isn&#8217;t unusually high; the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Age_adjusted_US_suicide_rate_by_race_1981-2016.png">CDC numbers</A> say it is slightly below the rate for non-Hispanic whites. Canadian First Nations suicide rates <i>are</i> <A HREF="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/99-011-x/99-011-x2019001-eng.htm">elevated</A>, but still only a third or so of Inuit levels. Maybe Inuits suffered stronger relocation pressures than other native peoples because of their Arctic environment? Or maybe every native group suffered a suicide spike, but Native Americans and Canadians have adjusted by now and their suicide rates have come back down? I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>The other theory about Greenland is alcohol. Alcohol consumption in Greenland skyrocketed around the same time suicide did, reached levels that temporarily made Greenland by far the most alcoholic country in the world &#8211; then started declining around the same time suicide did. This seems to be a pattern when hunter-gatherers with no genetic or cultural resistance encounter alcohol for the first time &#8211; Native Americans in the 1700s got up to <A HREF="https://longreads.com/2017/08/29/americas-first-addiction-epidemic/">some crazy stuff</A>. </p>
<p>But the Inuit seem to have gotten it much worse. <i>Now</i> we can bring back in the cold and darkness. Alcohol consumption seems to increase reliably with latitude, whether we&#8217;re talking about <A HREF="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm">the US</A>:</p>

<p>Or <A HREF="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/these-are-the-worlds-drunkest-countries-9357860.html">the whole world</A>:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/greenland_world.jpg"></center></p>
<p>So you take some hunter-gatherers who have never encountered alcohol before, stick them in the northernmost place in the world, and throw cheap Danish alcohol at them at the <i>exact</i> moment their communities are being uprooted and destroyed forever, and you get&#8230;well, you get this:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/greenland_alc.jpg"></center></p>
<p>By 1980, Greenland was the most alcoholic country in the world, drinking an average of 22 liters of pure alcohol per capita per year (Russia is 15). It doesn&#8217;t look like this was responsible social drinking either. Take the most deranged binge drinking in the worst college fraternity in the world, multiply it by a thousand, and that was Greenland during much of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>But this can&#8217;t be the whole story. Alcohol consumption in Greenland has since dropped to the same level as Denmark and other European countries. But the suicide rate is still ten times higher. Why? Maybe the moderate quantities are hiding deeply dysfunctional drinking patterns with lots of binging and addiction. </p>
<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s something worse. <A HREF="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40985-018-0085-8/tables/1?shared-article-renderer">Child sexual abuse rates in Greenland</A> range from 37% in Nuuk to 46% in East Greenland. As far as I can tell, you are understanding those numbers correctly &#8211; almost half of children in Greenland are sexually abused. In Nunavut, <A HREF="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-leaders-child-sexual-abuse-1.3843250">the numbers are</A> 52% of women and 22% of men suffering &#8220;severe&#8221; childhood sexual abuse. The <i>New York Times</i> sets <A HREF="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/world/europe/greenland-sexual-abuse-tasiilaq-denmark.html">a disturbingly vivid scene</A>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pay days are the worst time for the children of Tasiilaq, officials say. With their salaries or social benefits in hand, many adults tend to drink and parents become too inebriated to look after their children, officials say. That’s when an already high rate of sexual abuse rises, according to a police study published last week [&#8230;]</p>
<p>So on the last Friday of every month, officials open a sports hall in the district as a shelter to keep children away from sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“Children were abused by their stepfathers, cousins and by the neighbor looking after them as the parents were on a bender,” Naasunnguaq Ignatiussen Streymoy, the mother of a sexual abuse victim and an anti-abuse activist, told Weekendavisen, a newsweekly, in an article published on Friday about the crisis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Correlation is not causation. Maybe the same dysfunction or social alienation or alcoholism that causes the sexual abuse separately causes the suicides. But maybe the obvious answer is true, and the sexual abuse contributes to the mental health problems that eventually lead to suicide. Maybe a generation of staggeringly high alcoholism led to staggeringly high child abuse, and a generation later those children are still committing suicide at staggeringly high rates. </p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>This is getting really depressing. Let&#8217;s talk about something a little bit lighter, like the remote Siberian okrugs with the highest suicide rates in the world.</p>
<p>The highest suicide rate I have seen credibly attributed to an ethnic group is the Chukchi of northeastern Russia, who <A HREF="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/real-people-will-they-survive-21st-century">are said</A> to have reached 165 per year per 100,000 in 1998. They may be distantly related to the Inuit, but I wouldn&#8217;t put too much weight on this; Siberia is riddled with weird ethnicities with super-high suicide rates. The <A HREF="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282123638_Variations_in_suicide_method_and_in_suicide_occurrence_by_season_and_day_of_the_week_in_Russia_and_the_Nenets_Autonomous_Okrug_Northwestern_Russia_A_retrospective_population-based_mortality_study">Evenks</A> reached 121; their western neighbors the Nenets reached 119. There is a group called the Koryaks with a rate of 92, and another group called the Udmurts with a rate of 40ish &#8211; which is still higher than Guyana.</p>
<p>Voracek, Fisher, and Marusic try to tie some of these groups into their <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14620226">Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis</A>, claiming that the genetically-related Finno-Ugric group have a unique predisposition to suicidality. The theory has some superficial plausibility &#8211; in the 1990s, the world&#8217;s first, second, and third most suicidal countries were Finland, Hungary, and Estonia &#8211; all Finno-Ugric. Their surrounding non-Finno-Ugric neighbors, like Sweden or Austria, were unremarkable, so a genetic hypothesis made sense. Unfortunately for the theory (but fortunately for everyone else) these countries have since improved by a lot, and now are barely above the world average; improved mental health care may be responsible (and the fall of Communism didn&#8217;t hurt). I&#8217;m actually a little confused what happened here.</p>
<p>But the Finno-Ugric hypothesis can&#8217;t explain the Chukchi, Evenks, Nenets, Koryaks, and Udmurts. Sure, the Udmurts are Finno-Ugric. And the Nenets are closely related. But the Chukchi, Evenks, and Koryaks aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s tempting to group all of these tiny Siberian ethnic groups together, but eg the Evenks are more closely related to the Japanese than they are to the Nenets (despite living right next to them). Any genetic hypothesis flounders on the sheer genetic diversity and unrelatedness of this region.</p>
<p>Psychologist David Lester tries to point the finger at these groups&#8217; ancient culture, which he says has been especially suicidal since the time of the earliest records. He quotes an account of the 19th-century Chukchi:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bogoras described the [Chukchi] as irritable and obstinate and, when frustrated, impulsively self-destructive. He reports the case of a young girl who hung herself when her mother refused to take her to a feast in a neighboring camp. [He] reported cases of suicide in a husband over grief at his wife’s death andof a mother after her ten-year-old son’s death; a case motivated by bad fortune, compounded by the fear of further bad fortune; a woman who no longer found any pleasure in life; a young man who was driven away by his father-in-law for being lazy who then killed his pregnant wife and himself; and a young woman whose husband wanted to lend her to a friend in a group marriage, a friend whom she disliked. </p>
<p>Suicidal behavior appeared to be so common that people planning to kill themselves would often ask for a last meal of exotic tastes before they did so. Some Chukchee prefer to commit suicide by having someone else kill them. The man reported above who committed suicide because of present and anticipated misfortune asked to be strangled. In another case,a man who fell ill asked his wife to shoot him. Bogoras noted that &#8216;voluntary death&#8217; as he called it, suicide by getting others to kill oneself, was common for the elderly and those suffering from physical illnesses. </p>
<p>However, Bogoras also noted &#8216;peculiar&#8217; causes of voluntary death, such as that of a man who grew weary of quarrelling with his wife over their ill-behaved sons. Part of the motive in these cases may be to induce guilt in the survivors. As one father said, &#8216;Then he asks to be killed, and charges the very son who offended him with the execution of his request. Let him give me the mortal blow, let him suffer from the memory of it&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can only aspire to one day achieve this level of passive-aggressiveness. But in the end it has the same problem as the genetic hypothesis: these groups are just totally unrelated to each other. The Chukchi are not much more suicidal than the Nenets or Evenks, who have none of these traditions. And the Inuit are up there with all of them, and <i>they</i> had one of the lowest suicide rates in the world pre-colonization.</p>
<p>I think the explanation here is the same as with Greenland: the combination of alcohol-naive hunter gatherers, alcohol, the alcohol-promoting effects of high latitudes, and a disruption of the traditional way of life. There&#8217;s apparently a Russian proverb about Siberians <A HREF="https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/articles/2017/08/17/a-look-at-russian-reindeer-herders-battle-with-the-bottle">that goes</A> &#8220;reindeer-herders are sober only when they don&#8217;t have the money to get drunk&#8221; &#8211; and when the Russians are appalled by your alcoholism, you know you have a problem. Alcohol was <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958908/">found in the blood of</A> 75 &#8211; 80% of Nenets suicides. And if anything, the Siberians had their way of life disrupted even worse than the Inuit did &#8211; Soviet central planners tried to collectivize them as a PR move &#8211; they wanted to demonstrate that Communism could work for even the most primitive of peoples. Well, it didn&#8217;t, and here we are. </p>
<p>While genetics or culture may matter a little, overall I am just going to end with a blanket recommendation to avoid being part of any small circumpolar ethnic group that has just discovered alcohol.</p>
